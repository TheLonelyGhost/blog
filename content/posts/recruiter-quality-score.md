Although I know I'm incredibly fickle when it comes to who I'll work with when it comes to recruiting, the fact of the matter is that I value honest effort over the type to throw bodies at the wall. The shotgun approach is just lazy and rarely pans out. Here's my attempt at creating a rubric for my minimum barrier to responding.

Please understand that I am a privileged person. I know that. My reactions based on this rubric will be skewed toward my particular context.

This is coming from someone who:

- lives in a well-off area
- can decline offers due to savings to fall back on
- works in the software engineering industry with an in-demand language
- does not have outside obligations, requiring a rigid work-life balance
- has a reasonably up-to-date portfolio of work publicly available
- speaks english as a first language
- is a white male living in the United States
