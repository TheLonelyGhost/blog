## Platform

- Heroku / Dokku (docs written for both)
- Ruby
- OAuth2.0
- SOQL (Salesforce)

## Features

- Instructions for hosting on Heroku or Dokku
- Real-time streaming of errors to Heroku / Dokku logging framework
- Log entries summarizing successes and failures on each poll
- Adapter pattern for pairing Salesforce with Veritix environments, using the exact same data transformations

## Obstacles

- OAuth2.0 refresh token workflow requires a separate web application for capturing an initial token
- OAuth token eventually expires, so for long-running programs it needs to be refreshed periodically
