I am a developer with a focus on openness: open source, open information, open honesty. Being a polyglot, I choose the right tool for the job. Often this leads me toward Ruby, JavaScript, open web standards, and one of many GNU/Linux operating systems.

Communication is difficult, no matter the organization. That super-secret project you work on that your coworker isn't allowed to know about doesn't encourage collaboration, neither does the cryptic wall of code without so much as a comment for documentation. These may seem necessary, but in my experience they often mark an unsustainable, "good enough" internal standard.

My career goal is to squash that "good enough" standard, facilitating an open flow of information within an organization from point A to point B. I look for ways to streamline communication and to make the original intent of the code, documentation, or whatever else I work with be indisputably obvious.

Would you like to join me in this effort? Connect with me and let's see what impact we can have.
